      <div class="cont">Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. You have to make these big decisions. Just make a decision and let it go. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.<br>Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. And right there you got an almighty cloud. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. A happy cloud.</div>

      <div class="cont">Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. There we go. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.<br>Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? In this world, everything can be happy.<br>There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Anyone can paint. A beautiful little sunset.</div>

      <div class="cont">Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.</div>
